# BirdDetector
a program to detect birds on videostreams

A task is to develop an algorithm that can be easily ran on mobile devices and therefore it should value speed over quality.
The basic idea is to try out HOG descriptors, but in case of large datasets I'll try conv neural nets.


## Datasets

Here are some archives with square images of birds. If you split an image in 9 squares, bird's body is guarantied to be in a central square. Therefore, sometimes, tails do not fit in image.
